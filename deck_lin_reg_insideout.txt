###Question: a parameter that decides whether to calculate the intercept for
this model. If set to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
(e.g. data is expected to be already centered).

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True)

Note:

###Question: A parameter that if True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression.
This parameter is ignored when fit_intercept is set to False. When the
regressors are normalized, note that this makes the hyperparameters learnt more
robust and almost independent of the number of samples. The same property is not
 valid for standardized data. However, if you wish to standardize, please use
 preprocessing.StandardScaler before calling fit on an estimator with
 [this parameter]=False.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(normalize=False)

Note:

###Question: A parameter that if True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(copy_X=True)

Note:

###Question: A parameter that specifies the number of jobs to use for the \
computation. If -1 all CPUs are used. This will only provide speedup for n_targets > 1 and
sufficient large problems.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(n_jobs=1)

Note:

###Question: An attribute that shows estimated coefficients for the linear
regression problem. If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this
is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only one target is
passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.coef_

Note:

###Question: An attribute that shows sum of residuals.
Squared Euclidean 2-norm for each target passed during the fit.
If the linear regression problem is under-determined (the number of linearly
independent rows of the training matrix is less than its number of linearly
independent columns), this is an empty array. If the target vector passed during
 the fit is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.residues_

Note:

###Question: An attribute that shows an independent term in the linear model.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.intercept_

Note:

###Question: A method that fits the linear model.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.fit()

Note:

###Question: A method that gets parameters for this estimator.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.get_params()

Note:

###Question: A method that predicts using the linear model.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.predict()

Note:

###Question: A method that returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of
the prediction.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.score()

Note:

###Question: A method that sets the parameters of this estimator.

Answer: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.set_params()
