###Question: Explain the bias-variance trade-off as if your boss were five.
a. when you get more bias, you often have less variance.
b. simpler models are more biased because they group data into fewer categories.
c. more complex models are more biased because they overfit.

Answer: simpler models are more biased because they group data into fewer categories.
